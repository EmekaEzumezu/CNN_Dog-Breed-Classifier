Project Overview

This project is among the options provided by Udacity as part of capstone project for Machine Learning Nanodegree Degree Program, with the aim of creating an application that can be able to easily identify dog breeds when a dog image is provided as an input and predicts the closest resembled dog when an image of a human is provided as an input (just for fun). It also indicates an error when neither dog nor human image is provided.

With advancement in deep learning technology, we now have applications that now out-perform humans in identifying objects. The problem of people finding it difficult to properly identify and understand their dogs is part of what prompted this project. The trained image classifier will be intergrated into a smartphone and web app, where users of the app can use it to easily identity dog breeds of the image of dog taken with their phone or personal computers, it can also predict the dog breed camera is looking at without snapping the picture.

Dataset provided by Udacity in a GPU-enabled workspace, which consist of 133 dog breed categories, 8351 dog images (dog image link: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) and 13233 human images (human image link: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip), was used to train the model.
